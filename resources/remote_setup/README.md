## How to Use
- Create your own docker container for the workshop!
        - ``./start_container.sh <name>``
        - This has ALL of the content and the proper ENV you need for the workshop. 
- Go back into your container: 
        - ``./back_into_container.sh <name>
        - Once you've created a container keep using it :) 
        - To keep on using it, run this script to go back into it. 
- To run exercises: 
        - Use **tmux**. Otherwise, a new GDB terminal cannot be opened with start.py.
