## Heap Docker Container 
- This docker container is meant to be a replacement for the VM that we normally use. 
- To run, do the following steps: 
	- Install docker
	- Run './docker_run.sh'
- If you want to get back into the docker container, then run './exec.sh' 
- NOTE: Your work will be lost once you delete the container. To save exploits, copy them from the docker container to your local machine.

## Modules
- Intro to Malloc
- Vuln Classes
- Fd Poison
- Overlapping chunks
- Unlink
- House of Force

## Running Modules
- Open a 'tmux' session. This is so that the GDB process can split the screen. Without this, you'll get a bunch of errors.
- Start with the 'start.py' for the challenge. 'python3 start.py' will do. 
- ``*.c`` has the source code for the challenge. 
- ``solution.py`` has the solution. But don't peak! You're only hurting yourself :)
