## Flow of Folder
- First, read through the slides until the first exercise (UAF) comes up.
- Exercise1/ (UAF): 
    - When it comes up in the slides, do this exercise. 
    - Start with ``start.py`` until the challenge has been completed. 
    - Teaches you, with a hands on challenge, how use after free vulnerabilities can be used to pwn a program.  
- Go through more of the slides for the double free section.
- Do exercise2 for double free: 
    - Start with ``start.py`` until the challenge has been completed. 
    - Teaches you, with a hands on challenge, how double free vulnerabilities can be used to pwn a program.  
- Finish the slide deck
- Optional: 
    - There are a BUNCH of double free exploits in GLibC malloc. 
    - The directory ``double_free_playground`` is an easy place to test this out at.
