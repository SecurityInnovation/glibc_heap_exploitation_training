- GLibCMalloc.pptx: The slides for the overview of Malloc

## Flow of Folder
- First, read through the slides. 
- Exercise1: 
    - When it comes up in the slides, do this exercise. 
    - Start with ``start.py`` until the challenge has been completed. 
    - Teaches you, with a hands on challenge, what a chunk looks like. 
- Go through more of the slides. 
- Do exercise2 & exercise3 after learning about the ordering of malloc:
    - Start with ``start.py`` until the challenge has been completed. 
    - The goal (for both) is to get the memory in index 1 to line up with the allocation in index 10. This teaches you, how a hands on guide, to understand the ordering of malloc.
- Finish the slide deck
- Review the *cheatsheet* for the GLibCMalloc things
