## House of Force
- Timmys Stack:  
	- Options: 
		- Create node
		- Set node
		- Push 
		- Pop  
		- Show 
		- Queue Description
	- Data Structures: 
		- struct node (int index, char content[1024])  <-- Make larger than tcache (put into unsorted_bin) 
		- Hold in list (grows outwards) - have global index to keep track of
	- Startup: 
		- Create LARGE strings (or something) for initialization process
		- Two unsorted bin chunks and a tcache sized chunk (prevent consolidation) 
		- SHOULD be used then freed!
		- One of the unsorted_bin chunks should be the proper size, while the other should be smaller than what we need
		  putting the spot on the top_chunk
	- All of the 'nodes' being removed (on the top) are consolidated with the top_chunk right away with how the adding and freeing works
	- Use 'show' on the first created item for a LibC AND heap leak
	- Add and create against (chunk is now on the top) 
	- Pop from stack, creating a UAF on this top chunk
	- Write over top_chunk to setup house of force 
	- Create a LARGE note (hosue of force) 
	- Create (overwrite function ptr of some kind) 

- Binary Trees: 
	- https://www.cprogramming.com/tutorial/c/lesson18.html
- Melee Tier List: 
	- 5 tiers 
	- Add characters (indexed array) to tier 
	- Add notes on it (set size of these notes) 
	- Removed characters have a single spot for a UAF
- Simple: 
	- HITCON does not even bother with the libc and heap leak 
	- They have a trivial UAF
	- Overwrite top chunk to a function pointer on heap 
	- Then, get EASY shell func within the heap 
	- Use THIS to run house of force against (easy to show off) 
		

## First Attempt
- Did not find a viable way to perform this technique :( 
	- Could a full fd overwrite challenge for the future though! :)
- Interpreter of some kind...: 
	- Calculator with mem operations to values
	- Supports simple maths... 
		- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division 
	- Stores each operation in an array (checks mem address) 
	- Can remove operands (after they happen to make space) 
	- Can edit notes ONLY at the end
- Create notes to get FD overwrite (0x20?) 
	- Use as a leak first :) 
- UAF on register values
	- Use to leak libc
	- Use to alter the top chunk
- House of force via changing the note sizes :) 
	- Write to something that can get us code execution :)
