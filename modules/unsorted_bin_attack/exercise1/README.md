## Unsorted Bin Attack 
- Write-Where primitive by editing unsorted bin bk pointer

## Structure 
- magic_value.c: The challenge source code
- magic_value: The binary for the challenge
- versions/: Different steps of the solution process
- payload.py: Full solution to the challenge
- unsorted_bin.pptx: The slides for the technique 
- Makefile: Compilation script for the challenge

## Flow
- Go through the slides first
- Do each step of the challenge (start with an interface at step0.py): 
- Steps: 
    - Start *step 0)
    - Find the vulnerability (step 1) 
    - Set 'bck' to magic - 0x10 (step 2) 
    - Trigger (final)
