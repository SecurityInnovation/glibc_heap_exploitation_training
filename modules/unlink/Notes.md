## Overview 
- Unlink exploitation technique similar to the protostar heap3 


### Challenge Hopes 
- BASIC unlink bug
	- Should mainly focus on the bug itself 
- Mitigations: 
	- Bypassing the mitigations up until 2.24


### Interesting Insights
- For the basic challenge: 
	- Change LibC unlink to be the macro from 2.3.3 and below
		- Change all uses in malloc to be 'unlink_chunk' function
		- This is because macros are annoying to debug 
		- This will make debugging easier
	- Consider changing the heap allocation with mmap to have the executable flag
- Currently, not sure how the protected unlink works.
- The location of the executable changes the location of the stack because of env vars. So, need to change that location everytime.
