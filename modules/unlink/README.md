## Unlink
- Abusing the chunk unlinking for an arbitrary write primitive

## Structure 
- challenge1/: Easier unlink challenge (only edit 'fd' and 'bk') 
    - unlink.c: Source code for the challenge 
    - unlink: Binary for the challenge
    - final.py: Solution to the challenge
    - Makefile: The compilation script for the challenge
- challenge2/: Harder unlink challenge (add in consolidation) 
    - unlink.c: Source code for the challenge 
    - unlink: Binary for the challenge
    - final.py: Solution to the challenge
    - Makefile: The compilation script for the challenge
- Notes.md: Development notes for the challenges
- Unlink.pptx: Slides for the technique

## Flow
- Read through the slides until the challenge
- Do challenge 1: 
    - The only thing to edit is the 'fd' and 'bk' 
    - Simple and easy unlink challenge
- Do challenge 2: 
    - Same challenge but force consolidation to happen by overwriting `prev_inuse` bit of the ahead check.
    - Fake 'fd' and 'bk' 
- Finish slides: 
    - Read out the 'unsafe_unlink' technique at the end of the slides. 
- Unsafe unlink demo/technique in ``demo/unsafe_unlink``
