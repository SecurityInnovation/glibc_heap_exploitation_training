	A primer on Mmap chunks in GLibC
	==================================
	In GLibC, there is a point where an allocation is so large that malloc
	decides that we need a seperate section of memory for it, instead 
	of allocating it on the normal heap. This is determined by the mmap_threshold var.
	Instead of the normal logic for getting a chunk, the system call *Mmap* is 
	used. This allocates a section of virtual memory and gives it back to the user. 

	Similarly, the freeing process is going to be different. Instead 
	of a free chunk being given back to a bin or to the rest of the heap,
	another syscall is used: *Munmap*. This takes in a pointer of a previously 
	allocated Mmap chunk and releases it back to the kernel. 

	Mmap chunks have special bit set on the size metadata: the second bit. If this 
	bit is set, then the chunk was allocated as an Mmap chunk. 

	Mmap chunks have a prev_size and a size. The *size* represents the current 
	size of the chunk. The *prev_size* of a chunk represents the left over space
	from the size of the Mmap chunk (not the chunks directly belows size). 
	However, the fd and bk pointers are not used, as Mmap chunks do not go back 
	into bins, as most heap chunks in GLibC Malloc do. Upon freeing, the size of 
	the chunk must be page-aligned.

	The POC below is essentially an overlapping chunk attack but on mmap chunks. 
	This is very similar to https://github.com/shellphish/how2heap/blob/master/glibc_2.26/overlapping_chunks.c. 
	The main difference is that mmapped chunks have special properties and are 
	handled in different ways, creating different attack scenarios than normal 
	overlapping chunk attacks. There are other things that can be done, 
	such as munmapping system libraries, the heap itself and other things.
	This is meant to be a simple proof of concept to demonstrate the general 
	way to perform an attack on an mmap chunk.

	For more information on mmap chunks in GLibC, read this post: 
	http://tukan.farm/2016/07/27/munmap-madness/ or read the slides for
	this module. 

	NOTE: The version of LibC matters because of how mmap gives out memory. In 
	eariler versions of LibC (such as 2.23) the first mmap chunks were given directly
	above LibC. In 2.31, the chunks start directly below LibC. Keep this in mind
	when trying to port this exploit to another platform.

	With normal frees the data is still writable and readable (which creates a use after free on 
	the chunk). However, when a chunk is munmapped, the memory is given back to the kernel. If this
	data is read or written to, the program crashes.
	
	Because of this added restriction, the main goal is to get the memory back from the system
	to have two pointers assigned to the same location instead of using a pointer while it is in
