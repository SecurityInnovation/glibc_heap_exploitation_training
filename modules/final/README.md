## Final Challenge Idea
- Common protocol that most people know:
  - HTTP, SMTP, DHCP, FTP, ARP, IRC
  - HTTP seems to make the most sense - most well known protocol
  - FTP, SMTP have INTERACTIVE interfaces though... unlike HTTP.
- Bugs: 
  - Use after free 
  - Double free
  - Heap buffer overflow
  - Uninitialized memory leak
  - Out of bounds read
  - Race condition (TOCTOU) 
  - Integer over/underflow
