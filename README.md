# Overview
- Heap Training exploitation course for GLibC

## Folder Structure
- challenges:
    - Holds challenges for unique techniques (structure described in 'Assets Per Technique')
- demos: 
    - Showcasing of techniques
- libc_versions: 
    - Versions of LibC and loader
- old_challenges: 
    - Old/failed challenges
- resources: 
    - Miscellaneous scripts and things

## Introduction To Heap 
- Inner working of malloc:
    - Challenges: 
        - Fix
        - Golf1
        - Golf2
- Heap bugs:
    - Double free 
    - Use after free

## Techniques 
- Fd Overwrite (fake_chunks): 
    - Fastbin
    - Tcache
    - 2.32+ (pointer mangling) 
- House of Spirit (and the harder version of the challenge) 
- Unlink: 
    - Easy
    - Normal 
    - Unsafe 
- House of Force
- Unsorted Bin Attack
- Mmap chunks: 
    - Overlapping mmap chunks
    - House of Muney
- House of Orange
- New & IO: 
    - 2.32+ Pointer Mangling
    - House of IO
- TODO:
    - Large Bin Demo 
    - TCache Stashing
    - Shrinking/Growing chunks

## Assets Per Technique 
All of these are helpful per challenge but not all are implemented yet
- Challenge file: 
    - Challenge to test the knowledge of the technique
    - Source & compiled binary with the LD_PRELOAD section handled
- Solution - python pwntools solution: 
    - Checkpoints for going from stage to stage, if stuck. 
        - Currently, this is ONLY implemented for the House of Spirit
- Slides for the technique: 
    - Background of heap mechanics needed
    - Technique description
    - Challenge
    - Challenge Walkthrough 
    - Versions and situations
    - Other things to discuss
- compile script:
    - Patches the loader of the challenge files
