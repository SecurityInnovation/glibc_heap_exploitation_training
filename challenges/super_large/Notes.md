## Thoughts 
- Huge book storage, with a minimum book size of 0x10000 or something like that. 
- ``` 
	struct book {
		char title[40]; 
		char author[40]; 
		int book_chars; 
		char* content;
	}; 
	// However, the 'content' of the book is just at the end of the char* content
	// Min of 0x100000
	

  ```
	
- Can add books, edit and remove books.
- Use negative indexing/buffer overflow to edit the size of a book 
- Free/remove the book to overlaps the chunks
- Reallocate, but over the top of previous pointer
- Use for arbitrary write to get code execution
