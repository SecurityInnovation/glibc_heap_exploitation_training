At the start of the program, the heap has allocated FIVE items. 

We want the SECOND item to become the new TENTH item.

# Get the COUNT of stored items up to 8
for i in range(3):

Now, the unsorted bin is COMPLETELY empty and we want the current SECOND item
to become the new TENTH item. 

So, we will free TWO items. Because the unsorted bin is FIFO the SECOND item is
now at the BACK of the linked list. 

Ptr2 -> Ptr1, where we want Ptr2 or 'index 1'

# Free twice in order to get BOTH items on the list.
