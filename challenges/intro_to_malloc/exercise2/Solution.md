## General Thoughts 
This is just a heap grooming problem:  
- The unsorted bin is FIFO (first in first out) 

## Program
- The goal is to get **10** in the second ptr slot.
- There are two main options: 
	- birdie: mallocs a size of 0x100, adds the ptr to the list and increases the last_index by 1. 
	- bogey: Frees the chunk (in the ptr_lst) and increments the front_index.
	- win: Check to see if the 10 is in the second ptr slot.
- At the beginning of the program the birdie option is ran 5 times (0 indexed).

## Solving 
- The unsorted bin is FIFO (first in first out) 
- At the very beginning, 5 chunks are already allocated (0-4).
- So, we want to fill up this up all the way until 8 (just before 10). 
	- Allocate 4 chunks with the birdie (1) option.
- Because the unsorted bin is a LIFO structure, the **least recent freed ptr will the first to be used**. 
- So, we run bogey (2) **twice** in order to free slot 1 and slot 2.
	- Ptr 2-> Ptr 1, where the goal is to put Ptr 2 at slot 10
	- Ptr 2(slot 2) is now on the top of the stack
- Allocate once to remove Ptr 1: 
	- Slot 9 is now taken
	- Linked list: Ptr 2
- With ptr 2 on top of the bin, run birdie to allocate the chunk 
- Run the win function to get the flag.
