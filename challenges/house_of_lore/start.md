Thinking about a simple board game... 
- Have an out of bounds read bug on the board itself (on the stack) for a leak. 
- High score list or something along those lines to corrupt heap chunks 
- Corrupting the heap chunks when then perform the house of lore to add a chunk close to the ret value for later overwriting.
