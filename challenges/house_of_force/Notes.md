## House of Force Technique 

- First, use a read UAF in order to leak the heap and libc addresses.
- Second, use a one byte overflow in order to edit the chunk size of a chunk close to the top_chunk. 
	- Edit this to overlap a chunk that is currently being used. 
	- Have this be the chunk prior to the chunk that is below the top chunk. 
- Free a very large value: 
	- Malloc_consolidate will now eat up the top chunk, with the consolidation happening.
- Use the created UAF in order to overwrite the top_chunk size. 
- Allocate a HUGE size. 
- Overwrite free or whatever you want.
