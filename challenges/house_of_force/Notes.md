## House of Force Technique 
- Interpreter of some kind...: 
	- Calculator with mem operations to values
	- Supports simply maths... 
		- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division 
	- Stores each operation in an array (checks mem address) 
	- Can remove operands (after they happen to make space) 
	- Can edit notes ONLY at the end
- Create notes to get FD overwrite (0x20?) 
	- Use as a leak first :) 
- UAF on register values
	- Use to leak libc
	- Use to alter the top chunk
- House of force via changing the note sizes :) 
	- Write to something that can get us code execution :)
