## House of Force
- Timmys Queue: 
	- Only remove from the front and add to the back 
	- Array structure 
	- UAF upon remove an item from the queue (ONLY this item). 
		- With larger chunks, this forces consolidation, ONLY 
		  putting the spot on the top_chunk
	- Use 'write' to leak heap AND LibC
		- Could just GIVE heap or LibC leak, if this is an issue? 
                  won't work. 
	- Ask for size of data to store (whatever we want!) 

- Binary Trees: 
	- https://www.cprogramming.com/tutorial/c/lesson18.html
- Melee Tier List: 
	- 5 tiers 
	- Add characters (indexed array) to tier 
	- Add notes on it (set size of these notes) 
	- Removed characters have a single spot for a UAF
- Simple: 
	- HITCON does not even bother with the libc and heap leak 
	- They have a trivial UAF
	- Then, a EASY shell func within the heap 
	- Use THIS to run house of force against (easy to show off) 
		

## First Attempt... 
- Did not find a viable way to perform this technique :( 
	- Could a full fd overwrite challenge for the future though! :)
- Interpreter of some kind...: 
	- Calculator with mem operations to values
	- Supports simply maths... 
		- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division 
	- Stores each operation in an array (checks mem address) 
	- Can remove operands (after they happen to make space) 
	- Can edit notes ONLY at the end
- Create notes to get FD overwrite (0x20?) 
	- Use as a leak first :) 
- UAF on register values
	- Use to leak libc
	- Use to alter the top chunk
- House of force via changing the note sizes :) 
	- Write to something that can get us code execution :)
