## Challenges Need Specific Versions/Runs
-1: Anything besides GLibC 2.25-2.28 works fine.
	- Will likely just use 2.23 for this. 
-2: Need fastbins to be used: 
	- Use something prior to 2.25
-3: Add an extra parameter to the call...
	- This parameter trigger the larger chunks to be used.
	- Use something before 2.25
-4: Need a package prior to double frees in tcache: 
	- Use 2.25-2.28 for this.
-5: Need GLibC 2.29-2.31 for this to work.


## Challenges 
- Should have an 'execute' file for all of these.
	- Could do the black magic patching within the python pwntools script with the libc version?
	- Or, could have multiple versions of the binary, ready to run.
