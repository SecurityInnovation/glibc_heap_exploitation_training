# Overview 
- Learn about mmap chunks in GLibC and how they work

## House of Heap Style POC (DIY) 
- Write C code in order to make the POC 
- Learn ALL about how the 'how2heap' POCs are written

### Steps
- Allocate chunks into a vulnerable position
- Overwrite size (prev_size or size) 
- Free the chunk
- Allocate a new chunk

## Book Shop
- The challenge assocaited with this section
	- This is a fairly hard challenge to pull off. 
- There are two POCs for this: 
	- mmap chunk overlap 
	- House of muney (leakless mmap overlap) -- this can be difficult to get working, depending on the system

## TODO 
- Make a guide for a making a 'how2heap' style for overlapping mmap chunks. 
- This will probably be added as a bonus challenge (two of them!)
