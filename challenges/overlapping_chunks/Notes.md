# Overlapping Chunks
- The most common attack is to SIMPLY overlap two chuks in order to overwrite the content in the other chunk.
- In the past, this was EXTREMELY tedious to do... but, the tcache makes this nice and easy! :) 

## TCache
- Simply overwrite a chunks size that will go into the tcache bin... it is REALLY that easy! The POC (in payload) does this. 

## Fastbin 
- The NEXT size of the chunk also needs to be legit (cannot be too large or too small): 
	- https://elixir.bootlin.com/glibc/glibc-2.29/source/malloc/malloc.c#L4239
- Just a single calculated value is needed for this to work.

## Unsorted Bin
- Must have the prev_inuse bit on the nextsize chunk set: 
	- https://elixir.bootlin.com/glibc/glibc-2.29/source/malloc/malloc.c#L4324
- Legit nextsize: 
	- https://elixir.bootlin.com/glibc/glibc-2.29/source/malloc/malloc.c#L4328
- Consolidation validation checks on the previous chunk and the next chunk

## Technical Challenge Details
- TCache is simply and easy to use here. So, the POC will be taylor-made for the TCache version.
	- However, with the 'size' of the write we will make, we will make the unsorted bin attack possible for lower versions
