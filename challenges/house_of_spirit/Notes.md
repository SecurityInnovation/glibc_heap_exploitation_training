## Notes 
- House of spirit is not that good at getting code execution by itself. 
	- However, it works very well to create other primatives, such as arbitrary reads and writes. 
- The ordering of strchr is very specific... 
	- If jelly then butter, we would need the pointer to strchr to be slightly prior to this in order to have a proper system command
	- With this ordering (butter first) we can just put /bin/sh in the butter parameter 
- .bss and .data are under PLT/GOT on purpose! 
- The freeing of a chunk has an alignment check. So, it must be 8 byte aligned to free it (I think?)
	- Probably something to review for this. 
- Use with a different version of GlibC? 	
	- The current exploit works with ONLY 2.23
- Need to add some better comments to the end of the exploit
