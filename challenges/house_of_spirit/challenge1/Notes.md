## Slide Notes
- House of spirit is not that good at getting code execution by itself. 
	- However, it works very well to create other primatives, such as arbitrary reads and writes. 
- The ordering of strchr is very specific... 
	- If jelly then butter, we would need the pointer to strchr to be slightly prior to this in order to have a proper system command
	- With this ordering (butter first) we can just put /bin/sh in the butter parameter 
- .bss and .data are under PLT/GOT on purpose! 
- The freeing of a chunk has an alignment check. So, it must be 8 byte aligned to free it (I think?)
	- Probably something to review for this. 

### 2.26 Issues 
- For some reason, 2.26 does not work...whenever I changed the version the program crashes with a *Invalid address 0x0* error.
	- If we put a catchpoint on syscall 59 (execve) we will notice that all of the registers (besides RIP which is at _start and RSP_) are set to 0x0.
	- This is ALSO the case with 2.23 too though...
- If we make a change to the registers (right before execve gets called): 
	- Execve has three parameters (calling convention puts these in rdi, rsi then rdx)
	- pointer to filename (rdi) 
	- pointer to argv or parameters for the program (rsi) 
	- environmental variable (rdx) 
	- If we clear BOTH rsi and rdx prior to execution, the program runs as normal. 	
	- The call to SYSTEM should just work? Ahhh, this is annoying.

- System test: 
	- The *system* call here has a simple function call to system that outputs the current directory. 
	- However, with the 2.26 library this DOES not work. 
	- So, something else is going on... I think this should be okay :)
	- The tcache ptr overwrite has the same bug in it... appears to go into _dl_start_user then crash for an invalid address right after this. 
	- The new process is being ran. But, something is causing it to crash directly after this.
